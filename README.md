# Razorpay-Clone
  <h1>Mock Razorpay Payment Processing Interface</h1>
  <p>This repository showcases a front-end mock implementation of a payment processing interface inspired by Razorpay. Built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and optional JavaScript, it demonstrates core web development skills while adhering to security best practices by not handling actual payment transactions.</p>

  <h2>Key Features:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>User-Friendly Layout:</strong> HTML structures a clean and responsive interface with sections for user information, payment details, and potential pricing plans.</li>
    <li><strong>Visual Appeal:</strong> Tailwind CSS provides pre-built utility classes that streamline the styling process, allowing you to create an interface visually reminiscent of Razorpay's design.</li>
    <li><strong>Optional Interactive Enhancements:</strong> Basic JavaScript can be integrated to improve the user experience with functionalities like form validation or simulating button clicks that transition between different "payment processing" stages (without real transactions).</li>
   <li><strong>To Run Tailwind CSS :</strong>To run Tailwind CSS in your IDE you'll have to install Node.js in your computer after that you'll have to setup the Tailwind in your IDE via POSTCSS Documentation given in the website of Tailwind CSS..</li>
  </ul>
